App title: Schoolyard Defense

Works in MileStone3:

1. Add auto layout to support all iOS devices in portrait and landscape view.

2. Add win condition for "words filling" mode.

3. Minor bug fix.

Future extension: add more levels.  

User Flow:

1. Start the game and choose "words spelling" or "math" to play.

2. In "words spelling", player fill the words according to the image and a hint character. At start, the bear is 5 steps away. When the player give a correct answer, if the steps is less than 5, the cannon will shoot the bear and it will move back for 1 step, the score +10. When the player give a wrong answer, the bear will move 1 step towards the cannon. When the steps equal 0, an alert of game over will popup.

3. Players can use hint when they can not give the answer, and the score -5.

4. in "math" mode, there is a +/- calculation of 2 parameters that all less than 100. the effect is the same as the "words spelling" when players give a answer.
